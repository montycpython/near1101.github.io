# near1101.github.io

The goal of this project is to create a base of operations for
Research and Development. The code is available on Github to let
aspiring Developers see it, and, if they feel so inclined, they
can begin to tinker with it to gain experience as a coder.

Most likely you were invited here to begin your journey as a
software engineer. You're encouraged to ask all questions for
clarity and to donate to Monty the Developer.
