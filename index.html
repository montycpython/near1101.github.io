<h1><a href="http://127.0.0.1:5000">Hello, Prospective Developers!</a></h1>
<p>
    "Research and Development" is a provisional title for this working.
    Its Benevolent Dictator For Life is Monty Jones of Atlanta.
    Funding for this project has not yet been secured, so donations are
    <strong>strongly</strong> encouraged.
    We have a lot of work to do, so let's get started.
</p>

<p>
    The first step that we will take here at Research and Development is
    the step of establishing our main goal. And that is to successfully
    create software that is actually valuable to merchants and consumers.
</p>

<p>
    We are going to apply a very powerful strategy: Research and Develop.
</p>

<p>
    Some of you may already be involved in some Educational program that
    is preparing you to reach your personal goals. Hopefully, those programs
    will be of some use to you here.
